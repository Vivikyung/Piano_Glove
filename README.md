# Piano_Glove
A portable and compact wearable glove that can play piano.

2nd Place Overall at PennApps!

Works by using piezo sensors to sense "touch" above a certain threshold, one each attached to the fingertips of the glove so they're triggered by presses. 

In order to get a range bigger than 5 notes, the glove has an ultrasonic distance center (Brand: Ping)))) so that, depending on how far away your hand is from the nearest object to the right, it will play a different set of notes.
